= Copian

Copian is a suite of SNMP network device collectors. It provides an easy way of gathering information from SNMP enabled network devices. As of the current version it supports the following

- Network Interface Stats
  - MTU size
  - Connection speed (in bits)
  - Admin and Oper status indicating UP/DOWN
- Network Interface Bandwidth, including 64 bit counter support.
- Switch port to IP Address mapping
- Switch port to MAC Addresses
- VLAN listings

== Examples
Collecting the status of all the network interfaces on a Cisco Router

  require 'copian'
  collector = Copian::Collector::Cisco.new('192.168.1.1', 'public')
  collector.port_stats do |ifindex, ifname, mtu, speed, admin_status, oper_status|
    puts "Port #{ifname} is #{oper_status} @ #{speed} bps. mtu (#{mtu})"
  end
  # Port 1/e1 is 1 @ 100000000. mtu(1500)
  # ...

presently the admin_status and oper_status are not interpreted, but equate to

1. up
2. down
3. testing

- 1 major correction
  - BandwidthCollector fixed, it was incredibly buggy

=== 1.3.1 - 2009/10/06

- 1 patch
  - Fix symbol reference for the bandwidth collector from :64bit -> :b64

=== 1.3.0 - 2009/10/05

- 1 major enhancement
  - Added generic Bandwidth collector with support for 32 and 64bit counters
    to use the 64 bit counters {:64bit => true} needs to be passed to the
    bandwidth method on the collector.

=== 1.2.0 - 2009/02/04

- 2 major enhancements
  - Added VLAN collector to Dell collector
  - Added VLAN collector to HP collector

=== 1.1.1 - 2009/02/04

- 1 bug fix
  - Fixed HP ports collector incorrectly stripping information from
    returned ObjectID resulting in invalid MAC addresses

=== 1.1.0 - 2009/02/04

- 3 major enhancement
  - Dell collector with ports support
  - HP collector with ports support
  - Port stats, ifMtu, ifSpeed, ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus
- 1 extensibility enhancement
  - Introduced Generic Collector from which the others descend

=== 1.0.0 - 2009/02/03

- 1 major enhancement
  - Cisco collector supports Ports, VLANs and Addresses

=== 0.0.1 - 2009/02/02

- 1 major enhancement
